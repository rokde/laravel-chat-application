# Laravel Chat Application

This should be a reference chat application. I want to learn how to do that :)

Come and learn with me. I will commit every single step going forward.

## Local development

start local server in one console

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Then open your browser with http://localhost:8000.

Mail is configured for log -> you can register and verify your email by opening the [log file](./storage/logs/laravel.log) and clicking the link.

Building assets, open a new console and run

```bash
npm run dev
```
